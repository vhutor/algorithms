# Binary Search Algorithm

Binary Search is one of the most fundamental and useful algorithms in Computer Science. It describes the process of searching for a specific value in an ordered collection.

**Binary search** is a textbook algorithm based on the idea to compare the target value to the middle element of the array.

If the target value is equal to the middle element - we're done.

If the target value is smaller - continue to search on the left.

If the target value is larger - continue to search on the right.
